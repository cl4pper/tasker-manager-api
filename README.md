# api-boilerplate

My own Node-express api boilerplate to start projects fast.

Actually running express, jest and supertest.

### Instructions (npm run ```command```):
- server - to run the server (on ```http://localhost:3000/```)
- lint:fix - to apply prettier (see default config.)
- test - to run tests (just one time)
- testing - to keep tests running
